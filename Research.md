# Working Papers

“Congressional Organization and Information Aggregation” *Under review*
<font size = "2"> Congress delegates responsibility over monitoring any given problem to a specific set of agencies in the bureaucracy, raising concerns of tunnel vision characterized by the same set of actions monopolizing discussion of an issue. This paper examines how the committee system is structured to help Congress overcome these informational pitfalls of policy subsystems. I argue that the committee system produces a richer information environment by creating incentives for each committee to examine issues through different agency programs. To test my argument, I build an original dataset of over 640,000 witnesses that testify at every congressional hearing from 1973 to 2015. I provide evidence that committees prioritize the agencies they interact with during the legislative process. I demonstrate the wider utility of considering the different search dynamics of each committee by showing that more committees examining a problem result in a more diverse set of agencies providing information on the problem. </font>

“Oversight and Policy Responsiveness: Evidence from the Code of Federal Regulations”
<font size = "2"> A large body of work has examined how Congress performs oversight to prevent bureaucratic agencies from creating policy that deviates from the original mandate. Unexplored is how oversight can be used by Congress to bypass the legislative process to address new and evolving problems. I argue that Congress performs oversight to provide agencies with direction about how Congress wants to alter the existing set of rules that are in place to address new and evolving problems in the political system. To investigate the influence of congressional oversight on adaptive agency policy-making, I develop a new dataset that identifies the policy content of every regulation that has been enacted by an agency from 1970 to 2020. My analysis of over 36,000,000 agency regulations provides strong evidence that regulatory policy is responsive to congressional oversight. My results have important implications for how we understand oversight and congressional delegation more broadly. </font>

"Information Processing and Congressional Reform" (with Sean Theriault)
<font size = "2"> This paper reevaluates the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. While the act’s contemporaries may have been underwhelmed, we show that the jurisdictional changes it mandated had a significant consequence on congressional attention. At a broad level, the committee system operated differently after the act’s passage. A more fine-grained analysis shows even more compelling evidence. Committees that experienced jurisdictional changes had relatively more hearings; furthermore, issues that underwent change were the subject of more congressional attention. </font>


“Hearing Our Voices: The Presence of Minority Interest Groups in Congressional Hearings” (with Maraam Dwidar and Eric McDaniel)
<font size = "2"> We examine the conditions under which racial minority interest groups are invited to testify at congressional hearings. We argue that the policy content of hearings and racial makeup of committee members and staff are significant drivers of these invitations to testify. To test our theory, we leverage a novel data set of over 700,000 witnesses invited to testify at all congressional hearings held between 1973 and 2015. We find that minority interest groups are more likely to receive an invitation to testify at hearings held by more racially diverse committees. Subsequent results demonstrate that the presence of interest groups is the result of interest groups being invited to testify at a broader set of issues. </font>


“Party Identification and the Subjective and Objective Economic Vote” (with
Christopher Wlezien, Mark Kayser, Bailey Via, and Jan Zilinsky)
<font size = "2"> Numerous studies have demonstrated a weakening identification of voters with political parties in Western Europe over the last 40 years.  Previous research shows that this has led to increased economic voting, where less partisan voters place greater weight on (objective) macroeconomic conditions. Building on research demonstrating that individual-level economic perceptions are in part endogenous to party preference, we argue the degree to which economic perceptions are brought in line with vote choice also depends on partisan attachment. Specifically, we expect that trends in partisanship produce contrasting tendencies in the effects of the objective and subjective economy on the economic vote: low attachment reduces the subjective economic vote while increasing the extent to which objective economic conditions are considered in the voting calculus. The model not only accounts for trends in Europe, where partisanship has declined, but it also helps explain voter behavior in places where identification with parties has increased. </font>

#### Works in Progress

“University Influence in U.S. Congressional Hearings” (with EJ Fagan and Jonathan
Lewallen)
<font size = "2"> We examine the role of academics in providing expertise to policymakers. Researchers at universities are frequently asked by government officials to provide information used in policy-making. We argue that academics will be most useful to policymakers at the problem definition stage of the policy process. We test this claim by introducing a new dataset of instances where academics from research universities were asked to testify before Congress from 1973-2017. We find that academics are most often called to testify at early-stage hearings where no bill or appropriations are being considered, and are more likely to testify when policymakers consider establishing new programs or agencies. </font>
