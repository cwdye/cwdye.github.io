Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://colfa.utsa.edu/political-opinion/">Center for Public Opinion Research (CPOR)</a> housed in the Department of Political Science and Geography at <a href="https://colfa.utsa.edu/polisci-geography/">The University of Texas at San Antonio</a>. I use natural language processing methods to study regulatory policy-making, agenda setting, information processing, and bureaucratic politics. In the 2024-2025 academic year, I served as the Oversight Fellow at the <a href="https://www.levin-center.org/">Levin Center</a>. I received my PhD from the Department of Government at <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>.
